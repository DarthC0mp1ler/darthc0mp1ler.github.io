                <p class="genre-p">Action games focus on real-time challenges that test a player's reflexes, hand-eye
                    coordination, and
                    reaction speed. These games often involve combat, platforming, or fast-paced movement through levels
                    filled with enemies and obstacles. The emphasis is on physical skill rather than strategic planning
                    or narrative depth. Many action games feature simple controls but demand precision and timing,
                    making them accessible yet difficult to master.</p>

                <h1 class="genre-h1">Action-Adventures</h1>
                <p class="genre-p">Action-adventure games blend the real-time, reflex-based gameplay of action titles
                    with exploration, storytelling, and puzzle-solving typical of adventure games. Players often control
                    a character who fights enemies, navigates environments, and interacts with the world to uncover
                    narrative elements or complete objectives. These games offer a balance between combat and thoughtful
                    exploration, often with a strong focus on character progression or open-world design. They tend to
                    emphasize immersion and atmosphere while maintaining engaging moment-to-moment gameplay.  </p>

                <h1 class="genre-h1">Adventures</h1>
                <p class="genre-p">Adventure games emphasize storytelling, exploration, and puzzle-solving over combat
                    or action. They often involve point-and-click mechanics, dialogue trees, and the collection and use
                    of items to advance the plot. These games usually place the player in narrative-rich environments,
                    requiring critical thinking and decision-making to progress. Unlike action-adventure games,
                    traditional adventure titles de-emphasize real-time gameplay and instead focus on unfolding a story
                    through character interactions and environmental clues.</p>

                <h1 class="genre-h1">Role-Play Games</h1>
                <p class="genre-p">RPGs are centered on character development, story progression, and decision-making,
                    often within expansive and immersive worlds. Players typically assume the role of a character or
                    party of characters, complete quests, and develop abilities over time via experience points and
                    skill systems. RPGs emphasize choice, whether in how a character evolves, how the story unfolds, or
                    how to approach problems. They often feature dialogue systems, inventories, and stat-based mechanics
                    like strength or intelligence. RPGs can be turn-based, real-time, or somewhere in between, and may
                    appear in both single-player and multiplayer formats. </p>

                <h1 class="genre-h1">Simulations</h1>
                <p class="genre-p">Simulation games aim to recreate real-world systems, experiences, or scenarios with a
                    high degree of accuracy or believability. These games can simulate flying aircraft, managing cities,
                    raising pets, or running businesses, and they range from realistic to whimsical in tone. Players
                    often manage variables and systems over time, rather than engage in fast-paced action. The gameplay
                    emphasizes control, optimization, and long-term planning over winning or losing in a traditional
                    sense. </p>

                <h1 class="genre-h1">Strategies</h1>
                <p class="genre-p">Strategy games challenge players to plan, manage resources, and make decisions to
                    achieve victory, often against opponents or in complex scenarios. They require critical thinking,
                    foresight, and adaptability, with a focus on long-term success rather than immediate action. These
                    games can be turn-based or real-time. Victory often
                    comes through superior planning and execution rather than reflexes or speed.</p>
