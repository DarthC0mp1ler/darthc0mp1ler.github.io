                <p class="sub-genre-p">CRPGs are rooted in tabletop role-playing traditions and are known for deep
                    narrative experiences, complex character creation, and tactical or turn-based combat systems. These
                    games often include expansive dialogue trees, party management, and moral or narrative choices that
                    significantly affect outcomes. Many CRPGs are isometric and provide a top-down perspective, allowing
                    players to manage multiple characters simultaneously. Emphasis is placed on storytelling,
                    exploration, and strategy, rather than fast reflexes. Classic examples include Baldur's Gate,
                    Planescape: Torment, and Fallout 1 & 2. Modern CRPGs continue this legacy with rich, branching
                    narratives and updated visuals, like Divinity: Original Sin II and Pillars of Eternity.</p>

                <p class="sub-genre-p">Action RPGs prioritize real-time, fast-paced combat while still incorporating
                    core RPG elements like leveling, skill trees, and equipment customization. The gameplay loop
                    typically revolves around engaging in battles, collecting loot, and upgrading characters through
                    experience points and gear. ARPGs often feature fluid controls, reaction-based mechanics, and a more
                    immediate sense of player agency during combat. While story and world-building exist, they usually
                    take a backseat to gameplay intensity and progression systems. Popular titles include Diablo, Path
                    of Exile, and Dark Souls, with many offering deep combat systems and replayability. This subgenre
                    appeals to players who enjoy both action games and the progression mechanics of RPGs.</p>

                <p class="sub-genre-p">Dungeon Crawlers emphasize exploration of dungeons, often involving grid-based
                    movement and procedurally generated levels. Gameplay is typically centered around combat, loot
                    collection, and resource management, with a strong focus on tactical decision-making. Some dungeon
                    crawlers are turn-based and methodical, while others are in real time and more action-oriented. They
                    often include permadeath or roguelike elements to increase difficulty and replay value. The
                    narrative may be minimal, instead placing emphasis on atmosphere and player progression through
                    increasingly difficult environments. Notable examples include Legend of Grimrock, Darkest Dungeon,
                    and Etrian Odyssey.</p>

                    MMORPGs are large-scale online games where thousands of players share a persistent world, engage in
                    quests, combat, crafting, and social interaction. Players create characters and join guilds or
                    factions, often participating in cooperative or competitive multiplayer events. These games
                    typically feature extensive progression systems, including levels, equipment, and skills, as well as
                    rich lore and evolving game worlds. Social features—such as trading, chatting, and group raiding—are
                    central to the experience. The genre can include PvE (player vs. environment) content like dungeons
                    and story quests, as well as PvP (player vs. player) arenas and battlegrounds. Well-known MMORPGs
                    include World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy XIV, and Guild Wars 2.</p>
