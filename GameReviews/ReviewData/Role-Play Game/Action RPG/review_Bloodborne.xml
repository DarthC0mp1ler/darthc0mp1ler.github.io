    <summary>Frankly speaking I feel a little bit disappointed. Even though the lore is complicated and interesting, the environments are fascinating and the gameplay is the same old gameplay from the souls-like games, I didn’t get the emotions I expected from it. Probably I just know how to play Miyazaki games, but still… Most probably not really welcoming and pleasant to newcomers, but when you feel the vibe, you start to enjoy the thing. </summary>
