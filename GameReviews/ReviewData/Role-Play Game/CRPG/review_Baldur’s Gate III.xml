  <summary>The game that could be simply described by: do whatever you want, be whoever you want. There are almost no limits to what you can do, and each choice does not stop you from playing further (only if you destroy the world). This shows exactly what an RPG should be. Even though it is a turn-based combat, it does not feel irritating and too long as it was in Divinity series.</summary>
